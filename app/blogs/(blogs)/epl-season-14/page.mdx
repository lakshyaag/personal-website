## Introduction

The round-robin group stage for 5 teams in the [ESL Pro League Season 14](https://www.hltv.org/events/5554/esl-pro-league-season-14) concluded recently. Here, I take a look at how the **players** in Group D performed.

## Maps played and team performance

Before diving into the players' performance, let's quickly take a look at the map distribution for this group.

![Distribution of maps](/blogs/epl-season-14/maps_played.png 'Maps played')

**Mirage** and **Inferno** take the top place, played 7 times each, leading to a total of 14 out of a potential 45. Surprised to see **Ancient** in the mix

Strong map picks as we see **Liquid** dominating _Inferno_ and **Gambit** dominating _Vertigo_

## Player performance

### **Impact** vs **Rating 2.0**

![Impact vs Rating](/blogs/epl-season-14/impact_rating.png 'Impact vs Rating 2.0')

Some **key takeaways** from this graphic:

- _KSCERATO_ ahead of his peers with a Rating 2.0 of 1.30. To put this figure into context, note that **FURIA** did not qualify for the playoffs
- 4 players from **Gambit** and **Liquid** ended the group stage with a Rating 2.0 greater than 1

### Top players by **ADR**

![ADR](/blogs/epl-season-14/adr.png 'ADR')

_KSCERATO_ leading the group with an ADR of 89 across 341 rounds, followed by _hampus_ at 85 and _EliGE_ with an ADR of 81.

### Top players by **grenade damage per round**

![Grenade damage per round](/blogs/epl-season-14/grenade_dmg_round.png 'Grenade damange per round')

_NAF_ shaping up to be the grenade player for **Liquid**, with the highest grenade damage per round among all players in the group.

Super interesting to see all _5 players_ from **Gambit** show up in the top 10 list. It's not very often you see all players of a team having relatively high grenade damage per round.

### Top players by **headshot %**

![Headshot %](/blogs/epl-season-14/headshot_percent.png 'Headshot %')

**TeamOne** players have a relatively higher HS%, but just tapping heads did not prove to be enough for a victory.

_EliGE_ comes third with a 57% HS%, which is pretty remarkable considering the high impact _EliGE_ had in these matches

### Top players by **K/D Ratio**

![K/D Ratio](/blogs/epl-season-14/k_d_ratio.png 'K/D Ratio')

_KSCERATO_ leads this metric with a K/D ratio of **1.41**, followed by _sh1ro_ at **1.39**.

4 players from **Liquid** make the top 10 list, indicating a high degree of teamwork and a mentality of playing for each other

### Team ADR

It shows the **spread of ADR** of each player in every team. To be sure, a _longer violin_ indicates a _larger ADR spread_ in a team, i.e., **_a greater difference between the player with the highest ADR and that with the lowest ADR, indicative of under-performance._**

![Team ADR](/blogs/epl-season-14/team_adr.png 'Team ADR')

Some **key takeways** from this graphic:

- **Gambit** has a couple of players that can add even more firepower to an already impactful team
- **FURIA** need to finalize their fifth player - _guerri_ stepped up incredibly as he transitioned from a coach to a player, but it wasn't enough to push them over the line
- Both **Liquid** and **NIP** have a similar ADR spread

---

## Summary

**Gambit** had an amazing performance so far in the group, orchestrating impossible comebacks and losing only to **NIP** in their last game (which, in their defense, they had no incentive to win) . **Liquid** and **NIP** are through to the playoffs.

_Hobbit_ and _EliGE_ will be the key players to watch from this group. _KSCERATO_ would've been amazing to watch if only **FURIA** had got through to the playoffs

That's it for now! Hope this analysis was a little insightful. I'll come back with an overall preview soon.
