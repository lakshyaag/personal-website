I'm a self-taught Software Engineer at Bain & Company, building AI-powered tools for PE innovation. I transitioned from financial analysis to engineering, and have since built LLM solutions in edtech. I'm driven by translating complex business problems into elegant technical solutions.

Outside of work, you'll find me clicking landscape [photographs](https://www.instagram.com/lakshyaag/), chasing high scores in [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/), or experimenting in the kitchen as I learn to cook on vibes!

If you have an interesting project that you want to build, or ideas that you'd like to chat about, I'm always open to [connecting](mailto:${EMAIL}?subject=Hello%20from%20your%20website!)!`;
